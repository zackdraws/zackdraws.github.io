## 1. About 
Hello, read this file for a description on how this website works 
		
##  2. Folder is made of 
portfolio samples and html and styles.css that make a website

if you want you can make a fork of this to make your own website replacing my images with your own.

as long as the file names are the same files should go into website easily as long as you use a code editor like VSCode or Emacs and git to upload version changes
