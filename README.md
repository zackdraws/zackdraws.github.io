# Portfolio Site Project 
Simple Portfolio site using HTML, Styles.css and JS which together make a portfolio website. To display my work

# Introduction: 
 This was a personal project to make a portfolio site of to present my work. 
 The index.html is the homepage. The Styles.css contains the styling of the site controlling how the website is displayed. 

## - Index.html 
- This is the first page that you visit when you visit the site. Whatever page is titled index.html will be the homepage. The index page opens to a launch page containing the Animation Reel, Story Portfolio, Character Design, Background and Viz Dev.
### Pages 
#### Animation Reel (ANP.mp4 in file directory)
#### Story Portfolio (PDFs in file directory
#### Character Design (cd01.jpg, cd02.jpg, cd03.jpg ... etc.)
#### Background and Viz Dev (bg01.jpg, bg02.jpg, bg03.jpg ... etc)

# Website Styling
### Styles.css
Styles.css isn't an html website page it controls the settings of the html
Styles controls the css of website

### JS
For the lightbox feature to work I just used the lightbox js and it connects through the html on the site

        - Lightbox.js = javascript for 'lightbox' effect
  
# HTML-  Naming Files in Portfolio
My Portfolio images are in the folders /cd /bg and /fg and labeled with 01, 02, 03 after whatever are files are in those folders go into the website once they're uploaded to github

	- cd01.jpg (Files for character design) 
	
	- bg01.jpg (Files for Background), 
	
	- fg01.jpg (Files for Sketchbook) 

	  as long as you name the files like this and put them into folders they'll go right into the site that way I don't have to keep changing the file name and also the file.
