# Portfolio Site Project 

## install notes in case I forget 
mkdir - ~/website
git clone https://github.com/zackdraws/zackdraws.github.io.git

## 
- Personal project for my portfolio. 
- The [Index.html] is the homepage. 
- The [Styles.css] contains the styling of the site controlling how the website is displayed. 

### - Index.html 
- Index.html homepage
- My Index.html is just my homepage that contans my Animation Reel, my Character Designs, Background Art, Storyboard Portfolio, and Sketches. 

#### Pages 
##### Animation Reel (ANP.mp4 in file directory)
##### Story Portfolio (PDFs in file directory)
##### Character Design (cd01.jpg, cd02.jpg, cd03.jpg ... etc.)
##### Background and Viz Dev (bg01.jpg, bg02.jpg, bg03.jpg ... etc)

## Website Styling
### HTML-  Naming Files in Portfolio
My Portfolio images are in the folders /cd /bg and /fg and labeled with 01, 02, 03 after whatever are files are in those folders go into the website once they're uploaded to github

	- cd01.jpg (Files for character design) 
	
	- bg01.jpg (Files for Background), 
	
	- fg01.jpg (Files for Sketchbook) 

	  as long as you name the files like this and put them into folders they'll go right into the site that way I don't have to keep changing the file name and also the file.

### Styles.css
Styles.css isn't an html website page it controls the settings of the html
Styles controls the css of website
### JS
For the lightbox feature to work I just used the lightbox js and it connects through the html on the site

        - Lightbox.js = javascript for 'lightbox' effect
