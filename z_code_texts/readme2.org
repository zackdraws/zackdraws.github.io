* Portfolio Site Project 

** Introduction: 

 This was a personal project to make a portfolio site of to present my work. 
 The index.html is the homepage. The Styles.css contains the styling of the site controlling how the website is displayed. 
 
*** - Index.html 
- This is the first page that you visit when you visit the site. Whatever page is titled index.html will be the homepage. The index page opens to a launch page containing the Animation Reel, Story Portfolio, Character Design, Background and Viz Dev.

**** Pages 
***** Animation Reel (ANP.mp4 in file directory)
***** Story Portfolio (PDFs in file directory
***** Character Design (cd01.jpg, cd02.jpg, cd03.jpg ... etc.)
***** Background and Viz Dev (bg01.jpg, bg02.jpg, bg03.jpg ... etc)

**** Basic Template
- beginning has my website header- includes links to pages
- video container for framing and edited in css
- content 
- footer

** Website Styling
*** HTML-  Naming Files in Portfolio
My Portfolio images are in the folders /cd /bg and /fg and labeled with 01, 02, 03 after whatever are files are in those folders go into the website once they're uploaded to github

	- cd01.jpg (Files for character design) 
	
	- bg01.jpg (Files for Background), 
	
	- fg01.jpg (Files for Sketchbook) 

	  as long as you name the files like this and put them into folders they'll go right into the site that way I don't have to keep changing the file name and also the file.

*** Styles.css
Styles.css isn't an html website page it controls the settings of the html
Styles controls the css of website
*** JS
For the lightbox feature to work I just used the lightbox js and it connects through the html on the site

        - Lightbox.js = javascript for 'lightbox' effect

** Emacs
to edit my website I run emacs and just use 'httpd-start-serve directory which allows me to see a preview of my website @ 'localhost:8080. To see live updates I use 'impatient-mode' in Emacs (m-x impa mode) @ localhost:8080/imp/live and then I use git and magit to update.
** Premiere
for putting reels together
** TVPaint Animation 11
for animation
